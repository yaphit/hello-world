# hello-world
Following 10 minute guide

Yaphit here, I work in the fire service and am learning Python as a hobby. I have dabbled in programming before - Visual Basic, Java, Ruby and PHP. My most notable accomplishment was creating a fully functioning web based competency tracker for staff, which was used by my employer for 3 years. I haven't programmed at all for the past 4 years - promotion and increased workload took its toll on my work/life balance, but I think I have that addressed now. 

Its good to be back programming and am loving learning again. I intend to become profficient in Python (as a hobbyiest) and would like to work with others and contribute to building larger, more complex projects. My ulitimate goal would be to switch careers and become a full-time programmer - but at 43 I understand that is unlikely to happen.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and by all means, drop me a message - I'd appreciate your thoughts
